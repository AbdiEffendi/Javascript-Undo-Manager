SUMMARY

Simple undo manager to provide undo and redo actions in your Javascript application.


DOCUMENTATION

With each new/create action you call UndoManager.register(...) with these parameters:

param undoObj: caller of the undo function
param undoFunc: function to be called at myUndoManager.undo
param undoParamsList: (array) parameter list
param undoMsg: message to be used
redo params: you can figure these out...

So in an example create function would look like this:


function createPerson (name, id) {
	
	if (id == undefined) {
		// create id...
	}		
	// store name and id...
	
	this.undoManager.register(
		this, this.removePerson, [id], 'Remove person',
		this, this.createPerson, [name, id], 'Create person'
	);

}

To undo this action you write:

	myUndoManager.undo()

To redo this undo-ed action:

	myUndoManager.redo()
	
To clear the undo memory and lose all stored states:

	myUndoManager.clear()

Test if UndoManager has any undo actions:

	var hasUndo = myUndoManager.hasUndo()
	
Test if UndoManager has any redo actions:

	var hasRedo = myUndoManager.hasRedo()


	

To update your interface I recommend to use backbone.js that makes it easy to tie update functions to model updates.

A backbone version of the undo manager is also provided. Create an instance of UndoManager with:

	this.undoManager = new UndoManager()

	var onUndoChanged = function(undoManager) {
		$('.btnUndo').attr('disabled', !undoManager.hasUndo());
		$('.btnRedo').attr('disabled', !undoManager.hasRedo());
	};
	this.undoManager.bind('change', onUndoChanged);
		
		

If you don't use backbone.js, pass a function to setCallback:

	myUndoManager.setCallback(onUndoChanged)
